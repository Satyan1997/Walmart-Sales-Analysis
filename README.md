# üõçÔ∏è Walmart Sales & Performance Dashboard  
**Retail Intelligence Reimagined | Powered by Star Schema**

## üìñ Project Overview

This project explores Walmart‚Äôs retail performance across 100 stores in 98 cities using a custom-built dashboard powered by a Star Schema data warehouse. The goal is to uncover actionable insights across time, geography, product categories, payment behavior, and customer engagement.

We chose Walmart for its scale and complexity‚Äîmaking it the perfect canvas for retail analytics. This dashboard transforms raw data into strategic intelligence.

## üß† Data Architecture: Star Schema

The dashboard is built on a Star Schema for efficient querying and intuitive filtering.

**Fact Table: `SalesFact`**
- SalesAmount, ProfitAmount, Quantity, UnitPrice, Rating, IsWeekend, PaymentMethod, StoreKey, DateKey, CategoryKey

**Dimension Tables:**
- `DimDate`: Year, Month, Day  
- `DimStore`: StoreKey, City, Region  
- `DimProduct`: CategoryName, ProductName  
- `DimCustomer`: PaymentMethod, Rating  
- `DimTime`: IsWeekend, Hour

> The Star Schema enables fast, scalable, and flexible analytics across multiple dimensions.

**Insight:**  
Sales peak in December, but the real story is in the margins. Despite flat sales in 2023, profit surged‚Äîproof that Walmart shifted from volume to value.

| Year | Sales Amount | Profit Amount | Profit Margin |

| 2022 | $410K        | $140K         | 34.1%          |
| 2023 | $410K        | $218K         | 53.1%          |

**Recommendation:**  
- Forecast Q4 demand using historical spikes
